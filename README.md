## Project Overview 
Gestures are a natural way of communicating or clarifying ideas or intentions. This especially makes gestures a more user-friendly approach to gaming. Often when utilizing a controller, novice players are tasked with the initial learning curves of using buttons and joystick movements to perform successfully in a game. Furthermore, a controller can confine a player to more rigid and unnatural movements, resulting in the lack of immersion or gaming interaction. Considering this, the goal of this project is to enhance the gaming experience by detecting and recognizing gestures as the controls for gaming interaction. This is intended to be done using machine learning. Whether it is driving, dribbling, or performing a complex combination of hand seals, gestures can be an efficient and immersive way to interact with our favorite video games.

### Our Vision
FOR members of the gamming community WHO desires a more intuititive and immersive gaming experience without extra hardware and cost. THE Gaming with Gestures Project is a application THAT provides hand tracking, static gesture-based game controls, and dynamic gesture-based game controls. UNLIKE other hardware-based games or immersive gaming software, OUR product provides immersive gamming without the use of unique hardware, making it a more cost efficient and user friendly option.

### Personas and Key Features
#### Rebecca Black, A high school student at Villa Park High School
Rebecca, age 15, is a high school student studying at Villa Park High School in Villa Park, California. She has recently been accepted to the dance team at her school. During her first few practices, she has had a hard time keeping up with the moves. In fear of being kicked off the team for not showing improvement, Rebecca wants to make more time at home to practice so that she can perform the moves correctly and in time. She is aware of different gaming options she can explore to practice dancing, however she has an especially tight budget, and little time to learn new devices as she is not particularly tech savvy.

Rebecca, has taken interest in the Gaming with Gestures application because she understands that it is going to allow her the ability to still play popular dancing games, but without the high price or the hardware learning curve. Because of the Gaming with Gestures functionality to recognize dynamic gestures, Rebecca will be able to play her favorite dancing games and have her physical movements picked up and registered as game controls.

#### Timmy Ternur, A high school student
Timmy, age 16, is a high school student in the United States. He has a healthy interest in technology and videogames. His father works as a mechanic and his mother is a teacher at the nearby middle school. He is planning on pursuing a computer science degree when he graduates from high school.

Timmy has plenty of experience in a variety of gaming software. He is interested in a gesture recognition software as the controller for his videogames. He would like to avoid remapping all of his control settings for all of his games. As such, he would use the built-in settings to customize what gestures are assigned to which keys.

#### James Conor, high school student
James is a 16 year old high school student. He is a science student and is currently studying for
his SAT. He hopes to join his local community college in Computer Science. He plans to become a
game developer in the future.

He is a great student and in his free time he
likes to play video games with his friends. He has a gaming pc that he uses to play his games with.
He does not only have a keyboard and a mouse to play his games with but also other controllers
such as a joystick, steering wheel and pedals, etc.

#### Emily, A mother of two in San Fransico, California
Emily is a 27 year old mother of one who lives in San Francisco, California. She was born in Oakland to parents who were partially deaf at a young age. While Emily isn’t deaf, individuals in her family are, including her son. She moved to San Francisco due to her husband’s job and currently works as an IoT Specialist from home while she takes care of her son. She obtained a degree in computer science, at the California Institute of Technology, to help achieve her dream job of working in the field of technology. With a husband and son, she looks forward to a life of happiness in her family.

As an IoT Specialist, Emily has already done work in the coding field. She has used multiple languages and ultimately prefers to use python. In relation to this project, Emily believes that she could use the hand recognition features to help her son and other deaf individuals learn sign language from home. She has an interest in this project because her son can try to practice signing out letters and maybe some words while she has her own job to attend to.

#### Gustav, college sophomore

Gustav is 20 years old. He is a college sophomore, and is currently using his computer for school, but he has limited mobility because of neurofibroma. He has difficulty using the mouse and keyboard because of motor accuracy issues.

Gaming with Gestures can be adapted for controlling the mouse and keyboard through gestures by mapping the keys and mouse movements to certain gestures.
